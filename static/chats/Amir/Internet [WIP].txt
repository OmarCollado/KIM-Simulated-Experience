whaaaaat?? HOW DO YOU TALK TO PEOPLE?!
like you still have to talk to people right? like if you want to get a gun dropshipped DIRECTLY TO YOUR SPACESHIP you have to have something
i mean unless there's a different way to talk but how would you do that without a network
you don't use carrier pigeons in space lol can you imagine
like don't get me wrong i'd die happy if i had a pet pigeon that i didn't have to feed or remember to take care of or anything because it could SURVIVE IN SPACE
but there's no way that's a thing
that's not a thing right?

Drifter: [
    Stay on topic lol. Internet. >3
    Sorry, no pet superpigeons. >14
