FUTURE
I FORGOT
i didn't ask why didn't i ask about the internet before
maybe because it just EXISTS and i never really think about what if it DOESN'T
but WHAT IF IT DOESN'T
i mean you kind of get it but when you don't you reeeaaaaaally don't

    We have internet, but it's not like yours.

whaaaaat?? HOW DO YOU TALK TO PEOPLE?!
like you still have to talk to people right? like if you want to get a gun dropshipped DIRECTLY TO YOUR SPACESHIP you have to have something
i mean unless there's a different way to talk but how would you do that without something that's the internet
you don't use carrier pigeons in space
but that would be SO COOL LIKE
CAN YOU IMAGINE
oml if I had a pet pigeon that DIDN'T DIE IN SPACE i would be so friggin happy
