Drifter: So, I tried bringing some food back... >53

#35

Drifter: So, I tried taking some food through on my last trip... >20

#20

Drifter: [
    It smelled okay. Maybe we eat it when I get back? >8
    It looked... um, intact. Mostly. &ArthurDating>21:22
    Want to try it for me? >23

#53

Drifter: [
    And it smells okay, so I'm thinking we eat it for dinner. >8

#21

Broadsword: You need to work on your sales pitch, love. >8

#22

Broadsword: You need to work on your sales pitch, mate. >8

#23

Broadsword: I don't like what you're implying.

Drifter: [
    What am I implying? >24
    It's fine. It's safe... I think. &ArthurDating>27:28
    &!ArthurDating Bet I can get Quincy to try it. &QuincyDating>31:32

#31

Broadsword: Do you know how low of a bar that is for you?
Broadsword: I'm not risking it. >E

#32

Broadsword: That's not the call to action you think it is.
Broadsword: Pass. >E

#27

Broadsword: Sol above, the things I do for you...
Broadsword: What kind of food is it? >29

#28

Broadsword: You're a shining beacon of confidence...
Broadsword: I'm going to stay out of this.
Broadsword: You might try Quincy, though. >E

#24

Broadsword: That you wouldn't touch it with a ten foot pole. &ArthurDating>27:26

#26

Broadsword: If I didn't know better, I'd say you're trying to murder me.
Broadsword: Not interested, sorry. >E

#8

Broadsword: What kind is it? >29

#29

Drifter: [
Zariman rations. >2
Kuaka stew. &ArthurKomiRodent>5:17
Some kind of gunk packet from Fortuna. >4
]

#2

Broadsword: The kind that's all squares?
Broadsword: Well... I'm curious.

Drifter: [
It's pretty good. >9
It's pretty bad. >10
&SquareSpaghetti 100% gelatin-free. &ArthurDating>11:30

#9

&ArthurAteSquares=TRUE

Broadsword: Looking forward to it, then. >E

#11

Broadsword: Are you *ever* going to let that go? Or am I stuck with it for all of eternity?

Drifter: [
    Stuck with it. >37
    Nah, it's getting kind of old. I won't bring it up again. >36
]

#37

Broadsword: Ugh.
Broadsword: I'll still eat your squares, but it might be out of spite. >E

#36

&SquareSpaghetti=FALSE

Broadsword: Thank Sol for small miracles.
Broadsword: Looking forward to trying your "squares." >E

#30

Broadsword: I've changed my mind. >E

#10

&ArthurAteSquares=TRUE

Broadsword: But you want to eat it for dinner?! &ArthurDating>12:13

#12

Broadsword: Sigh.
Broadsword: Not really sure what it says about me that I'm still game for this.

Drifter: [
    That you love me. :) >14
    That you're a sucker. >15
    Not sure what it says about me, either. >16
]

#14

Broadsword: I do.
Broadsword: Don't abuse your power too often, sweets.
Broadsword: I'll see you at dinner. >E

#15

Broadsword: Clearly. >E

#16

Broadsword: I'll find us something to wash it down with... >E

#13

Broadsword: Fine. I'll join, but I won't promise not to insult it. >E

#4

&ArthurAteGunk=TRUE

Broadsword: "Gunk packet"?
Broadsword: Not to ruin it for you, but we might have a few "gunk packets" laying around as it is.
Broadsword: Rations — MREs. Chicken paté flavour.
Broadsword: Tastes a bit like cat food.

Drifter: [
    So... Does that mean you don't want to try it? >33
    You eat cat food? &ArthurDating>34:52
    Someone has to like it, right? >38
]

#38

Broadsword: Not in the least.
Broadsword: Eleanor has a pet theory that they've actually been discontinued for years.
Broadsword: They're shuffled around storerooms for a bit, then end up back at HQ.
Broadsword: She's certain someone makes an excuse about "the budget" and redistributes them to the next poor sods.
Broadsword: Only reason I know it isn't true is because Quincy keeps feeding ours to the local strays.

Drifter: [
    Quincy's not a cat person, is he? >39
]

#39

Broadsword: Hardly. He's in it for the FRHs.
Broadsword: Doesn't want the food going to total waste, is all.

Drifter: [
    What's an FRH? >40
    Why does he want FRHs? >41
]

#40

Broadsword: The little heaters.
Broadsword: Not as useful for us, but most soldiers don't get to hole up in a place with a food court.
Broadsword: The fun comes in using them to blow holes in plastic bottles.

Drifter: [
    They explode?! >42
    LOL >42
]

#42

Broadsword: Don't get too excited. They're noisemakers, at best. >65

#65

Broadsword: Can't say they aren't dangerous, but I saw worse in secondary school.
Broadsword: At least Quincy knows better than to use them for pranks.

Drifter: [
    Quincy? I'm not so sure. >43
    Too bad. Sounds like he's missing out. >44
]

#44

Broadsword: Don't make me warn you off, as well...
Broadsword: In case it hasn't occurred to you: when a plastic bottle explodes,
Broadsword: for civvies, it sounds near enough to a gunshot.
Broadsword: Sol knows every time a car backfires someplace, it's an everloving bloody "incident."

Drifter: So what *does* Quincy do with them? >45

#45

Broadsword: Puts on a show in the car park. "Science lessons," he says.
Broadsword: Children can't get enough of it, that's for certain.
Broadsword: I keep myself busy around those times. Pretend I don't know about it.
Broadsword: More for his ego than anything else.
Broadsword: Don't tell him I said that.

Drifter: [
    Secret's safe with me. >51
    No way am I keeping that to myself, lol. >46
]

#46

Broadsword: Can't imagine he'd be happy to hear it.
Broadsword: But that's on your shoulders, not mine. >47

#51

Broadsword: Appreciate it. And the chat. Not looking forward to the paté. &ArthurDating>48:49

#47

Broadsword: Appreciate the chat. Not looking forward to the paté. &ArthurDating>48:49

#48

Broadsword: But I'm looking forward to your company. >E

#49

Broadsword: But, who knows? Might even be edible, if I'm lucky. >E

#43

Broadsword: Heh. Can't blame you.
Broadsword: I'm only as confident because I know what he's doing with them. >45

#41

Broadsword: They're a little explosive, if you know what to do with them. >65

#34

Broadsword: I meant the bleeding *smell,* love. >50

#58

Broadsword: Bring one by my office when you can. Let's get it over with. >E

#52

Broadsword: I meant the bleeding *smell,* mate! >50

#50

Drifter: [
    :) >33
    Sure, sure. >33
]

#33

Broadsword: Sigh.
Broadsword: Let me find a drink to wash it down with. >E

#17

&ArthurAteKuaka=TRUE

Broadsword: Kuaka are rodents, aren't they? &LettieDating>7:18

#18

&ArthurKomiRabbit Broadsword: Or are they rabbits?
Broadsword: Must taste all right if somebody's making stew out of it. &ArthurDating>6:19

#19

Broadsword: But you might want to be... cautious, if you ask Lettie in. >E

#7

Broadsword: You might want to run this by Lettie, mate. >E

#6

Broadsword: I'll find us some drinks to wash it down. >E

#5

&ArthurAteKuaka=TRUE

Broadsword: You play komi with a rodent, and you also eat them.

Drifter: Different rodent, but yeah. >3

#3

Broadsword: I still wouldn't tell Lettie, if I were you. >E
