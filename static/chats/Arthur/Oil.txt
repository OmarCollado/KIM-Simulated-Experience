Broadsword: We're running low on gun oil.
Broadsword: Amir's set to pilfer it from Viktor's crew in the next few days.
Broadsword: I've left some motor oil with the cleaning supplies to tide us over.
Broadsword: Use it only if you have to.

Drifter: [
I'm reading that as "Use more space lasers today, Drifter." &ArthurDating>2:3
Motor oil? Is that safe? >5
I have my own supply. >19
Got it, thanks. >E

Broadsword: I would've used a term of endearment, sweets, but that's close enough. >33

#3

Broadsword: Heh. Exactly right.
Broadsword: If you want targets for those "space lasers," grab something off the board.
Broadsword: There's a miserable backlog. >E

#19

Broadsword: Are you offering?

Drifter: [
    Yeah, of course. &ArthurDating>20:21
    LOL. >23

#23

Broadsword: Should've known. >E

#20

Broadsword: I could kiss you right now. >22

#21

Broadsword: You're spoiling us, mate. >22

#22

Broadsword: Drop it by when you can. I'll let the others know. >E

#4

Broadsword: Right. This is what I get for trying to be nice.
Broadsword: I'll leave you off next time. >E

#5

Broadsword: Not exactly "manufacturer recommended," but it does well enough in a pinch.

Drifter: [
    I can't imagine what situation made you even think of trying that. >18
    Good info. Thanks. >E

#18

Broadsword: Not my idea. Picked it up from a commander my first year in.
Broadsword: Might've been the only *useful* thing he ever tried to teach us.

Drifter: He had a lot of not-useful info? >6

#6

Broadsword: He was an encyclopaedia of stupid trivia. King of his hometown pub quiz, he said.
Broadsword: Cruel. Full of himself. Never once took blame if he could shunt it off to someone else.

Drifter: [
    So, the opposite of you. &ArthurDating>7:13
    Bet you hated his guts. >25

#25

Broadsword: For the most part.
Broadsword: He was everything I didn't want to be.

Drifter: [
Based on how you're describing the guy? I'd say you won that one. &ArthurDating>7:13
&!ArthurSelfCritic You're too self-critical to ever be full of it. &ArthurDating>10:14
At least you don't have to deal with him anymore. >17

#7

Broadsword: You always see the best in me. &ArthurSelfCritic>33:30

#30

Drifter: You don't, so I have to. >8

#8

Broadsword: There's... a lot I could say to that. >16

#9

Broadsword: Grab a bounty off the board if you need to take it out on something. >E

#10

Drifter: And I mean that in the most affectionate way possible. >11

#11

Broadsword: I'd argue that, but it'll have to be some other time. >12

&ArthurSelfCritic=TRUE

Broadsword: Today being the minor shitshow that it is.

Drifter: [
That's fine, I get it. We'll talk later. &ArthurDating>31:27
Sounds like an excuse. >9

#31

Broadsword: Thanks, love. And, one more thing, before I'm back to work —
Broadsword: No matter how long today's "shitshow" drags on, I won't miss our dinner date.
Broadsword: Viktor will have to do a lot worse to deny me *that.* >E

#33

Broadsword: One more thing, before I'm back to work — we're up to our ears in it, today.
Broadsword: ...To the point that the duty rota's more of a *suggestion* than a proper schedule...
&Sexy Broadsword: I might need a rain check on our "extracurriculars."
Broadsword: But I won't miss our dinner date. >E

#24

Broadsword: I'll be getting back to work. Sodding shitshow today, courtesy of our friend Viktor. >27

#27

Broadsword: If you're free, grab something off the board.
Broadsword: There's a miserable backlog. >E

#13

Broadsword: I'd like to think so. Bloody low bar for me to clear, though. >24

#14

Drifter: [
    And I'm not trying to insult you. It's just true. >11
    Seriously. You need to chill out sometimes. >15

#15

Broadsword: Well, this sounds like an old powderkeg.
Broadsword: Look, mate. I've no issue digging in on that. >16

#16

Broadsword: But I'll have to defer. >12

#17

Broadsword: Hah. Very true. &ArthurDating>33:24
