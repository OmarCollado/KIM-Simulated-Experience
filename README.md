## What browsers are supported?
No idea.

## Why do this?
Started writing a fic. Ended up with multiple "paths." Said to myself, "Well, that seems like a solid ADHD rabbit hole" and, "I might be the first person I know to have a legitimate use for inset/outset borders in 2025!"\
Aaaaaand here we are.

## Can you do XYZ?!
Maybe? Ideas are nice. But I do have a day job.

## What in the actual _hell_ is that dialogue format?!
Well, my options were:
1. Find some kind of useful scenario-writing flowchart app or web app with a good interface, that works on my phone, has autosave, minimizes manual file loads, either cloud syncs for free or stores files in an unencrypted folder so I can set up cloud sync with a different app, doesn't spam me with ads, and doesn't want a billion inappropriate permissions.\
**— OR —**
2. Wing it in the same notepad app I've used for years.

## Yeah, but you still could've used JSON or something.
Nah. Not feelin' it.
